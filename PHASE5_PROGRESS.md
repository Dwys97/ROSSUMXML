## üìù Notes & Decisions

### October 10, 2025 - Project Kickoff
- Created `feature/phase5-admin-dashboard` branch
- Established planning documents (PHASE5_PLANNING.md, PHASE5_PROGRESS.md)
- Ready to begin implementation

### Decisions Made
- **Chart Library:** Chart.js (lightweight, good React support)
- **Table Library:** TanStack Table v8 (modern, flexible)
- **Export Libraries:** papaparse (CSV), jsPDF (PDF)
- **No backend changes:** Use existing Phase 4 APIs
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks (15 working days)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Chart performance with large datasets
  - **Mitigation:** Aggregate data server-side, limit chart data points
- **Risk:** Export large reports (5000+ events)
  - **Mitigation:** Implement pagination for exports, warn user
- **Risk:** Real-time updates may cause UI flicker
  - **Mitigation:** Use React Query's background refetch, optimize re-renders
