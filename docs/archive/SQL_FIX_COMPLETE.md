# ‚úÖ SQL Query Fixes Complete

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/security-features`  
**Issue:** 2 SQL syntax errors in integration tests  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## üîß Problem Identified

During integration testing, 2 tests were failing due to PostgreSQL SQL syntax errors:

### Error 1: Test 1.3 - Authentication Audit Check
```
ERROR: column "security_audit_log.created_at" must appear in the GROUP BY clause 
       or be used in an aggregate function
```

**Location:** Line 88 in `test-integration.sh`

**Problematic Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM security_audit_log 
WHERE event_type = 'authentication_success' 
  AND user_id = '$USER_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Issue:** Using `ORDER BY created_at` with `COUNT(*)` is meaningless and causes SQL error because:
- `COUNT(*)` returns a single aggregated row
- Cannot order an aggregate result by a column not in GROUP BY
- `LIMIT 1` is redundant with `COUNT(*)`

### Error 2: Test 2.2 - XML Threat Audit Check
```
ERROR: column "security_audit_log.created_at" must appear in the GROUP BY clause 
       or be used in an aggregate function
```

**Location:** Line 138 in `test-integration.sh`

**Problematic Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM security_audit_log 
WHERE event_type = 'xml_security_threat_detected' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Issue:** Same as Error 1 - invalid `ORDER BY` with `COUNT(*)`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix Applied

### Fix 1: Line 88
**Before:**
```bash
AUDIT_CHECK=$(docker exec rossumxml-db-1 psql -U postgres -d rossumxml -t -c \
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM security_audit_log WHERE event_type = 'authentication_success' AND user_id = '$USER_ID' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;")
```

**After:**
```bash
AUDIT_CHECK=$(docker exec rossumxml-db-1 psql -U postgres -d rossumxml -t -c \
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM security_audit_log WHERE event_type = 'authentication_success' AND user_id = '$USER_ID';")```

**Changes:** Removed `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`

### Fix 2: Line 138
**Before:**
```bash
THREAT_LOG_COUNT=$(docker exec rossumxml-db-1 psql -U postgres -d rossumxml -t -c \
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM security_audit_log WHERE event_type = 'xml_security_threat_detected' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;")
```

**After:**
```bash
THREAT_LOG_COUNT=$(docker exec rossumxml-db-1 psql -U postgres -d rossumxml -t -c \
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM security_audit_log WHERE event_type = 'xml_security_threat_detected';")
```

**Changes:** Removed `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

The test queries were originally written to verify "the most recent" audit log entry by using:
```sql
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

However, when combined with `COUNT(*)`, this creates a logical error:
- `COUNT(*)` aggregates all matching rows into a single count
- `ORDER BY` tries to sort individual rows before aggregation
- PostgreSQL requires columns in `ORDER BY` to be in `GROUP BY` when using aggregates
- Since there's no `GROUP BY`, and `COUNT(*)` is an aggregate, this causes a syntax error

### Correct Approach:

For counting rows, simply use:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE condition;
```

If you need the most recent row's data (not count), use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

But **never** combine `COUNT(*)` with `ORDER BY` on non-grouped columns.
