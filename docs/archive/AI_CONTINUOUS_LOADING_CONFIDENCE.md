## 🎯 User Requirements

> "Ok it should keep loading up more suggestions while user works on accepting others, and also make sure it only returns suggestions with confidence score above 50%"

### Two Key Improvements:
1. **Continuous Background Loading** - Keep pool of suggestions filled while user works
2. **Confidence Threshold** - Only show suggestions ≥50% confidence

---

## ✅ Solution Implementation

### 1. Confidence Threshold Filtering (≥50%)

**Implementation**: Added `MIN_CONFIDENCE = 50` filter to all suggestion generation points

#### Initial Generation:
```javascript
// 🔒 CRITICAL: Filter out any non-leaf suggestions and low-confidence suggestions
const MIN_CONFIDENCE = 50; // Only show suggestions with confidence ≥50%
const validSuggestions = (result.suggestions || []).filter(suggestion => {
    const sourceIsLeaf = suggestion.sourceElement?.isLeaf !== false;
    const targetIsLeaf = suggestion.targetElement?.isLeaf !== false;
    const hasGoodConfidence = suggestion.confidence >= MIN_CONFIDENCE;
    
    if (!sourceIsLeaf || !targetIsLeaf) {
        console.warn('⚠️  Filtered out non-leaf suggestion:', {
            source: suggestion.sourceElement?.name,
            target: suggestion.targetElement?.name
        });
        return false;
    }
    
    if (!hasGoodConfidence) {
        console.warn(`⚠️  Filtered out low-confidence suggestion: ${suggestion.sourceElement?.name} → ${suggestion.targetElement?.name} (${suggestion.confidence}%)`);
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
});

const filteredCount = (result.suggestions?.length || 0) - validSuggestions.length;
if (filteredCount > 0) {
    console.log(`🔒 Filtered ${filteredCount} suggestions (non-leaf or confidence <${MIN_CONFIDENCE}%)`);
}
```

**Applied To**:
- ✅ Initial batch generation (`handleBatchAISuggest`)
- ✅ Dynamic loading after accept (`handleAcceptBatchSuggestions`)
- ✅ Dynamic loading after delete (`handleDeleteBatchSuggestion`)
- ✅ Single regeneration (`handleRegenerateOneSuggestion`)

### 2. Continuous Background Loading

**Old Behavior**:
```javascript
// Only load when down to 1 suggestion
if (visibleCount < 2) {
    loadMore();
}
```

**New Behavior**:
```javascript
// Keep pool filled with at least 5 suggestions
const MIN_VISIBLE_SUGGESTIONS = 5;
if (visibleCount < MIN_VISIBLE_SUGGESTIONS && remainingUnmappedCount > 0) {
    loadMore();
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. User accepts a suggestion → `visibleCount` decreases
2. Check: `visibleCount < 5`?
3. If yes AND unmapped elements exist → Load 3 more in background
4. User continues working while AI generates
5. New suggestions appear automatically when ready
6. Repeat until all elements mapped

**Example Flow**:
```
Start: 3 suggestions shown (after initial load)
User accepts 1 → visibleCount = 2 → Trigger load (< 5)
  ↓ Background loading starts (3 more)
User accepts 1 more → visibleCount = 1
  ↓ Still loading in background
AI finishes → visibleCount = 1 + 3 = 4
  ↓ Still < 5, trigger another load
Background loads 3 more → visibleCount = 7
  ↓ Now ≥ 5, no trigger
User works through suggestions...
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Before Changes:

| Scenario | Behavior | User Experience |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 3 suggestions shown | User accepts 2 | Only 1 left, then waits 12-14s for more |
| Low confidence (10%) | Shows anyway | User wastes time on bad suggestions |
| User accepts quickly | Must wait for load | Interrupts workflow |

### After Changes:

| Scenario | Behavior | User Experience |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 3 suggestions shown | User accepts 2 | Already loading more in background |
| Low confidence (10%) | **Filtered out** | Only sees good matches |
| User accepts quickly | Pool stays filled | Smooth continuous workflow |

## 🔍 Confidence Threshold Details

### What Gets Filtered:

**Confidence < 50%**:
- Very low matches (5-15%): No semantic alignment
- Poor matches (20-40%): Wrong level or weak name similarity
- Medium-low matches (40-49%): Borderline cases

**Confidence ≥ 50%**:
- Medium matches (50-69%): Decent semantic match
- Good matches (70-89%): Strong alignment
- Excellent matches (90-100%): Near-perfect match

### Example Filtering:

**Before** (all suggestions shown):
```
1. InvoiceDate → IssueDate (85%) ✅ Good
2. InvoiceDate → Date (72%) ✅ Good
3. InvoiceDate → ReferenceNumber (10%) ❌ Bad
4. DocumentType → Type (95%) ✅ Excellent
5. DocumentType → Code (45%) ❌ Borderline
```

**After** (≥50% only):
```
1. InvoiceDate → IssueDate (85%) ✅ Shown
2. InvoiceDate → Date (72%) ✅ Shown
4. DocumentType → Type (95%) ✅ Shown
```

**Result**: User sees only 3 high-quality suggestions instead of 5 mixed-quality

## 🔄 Continuous Loading Flow

### Detailed Workflow:

```
1. Initial Generation (3 suggestions)
   ├─> AI generates 6 suggestions
   ├─> Filter: 4 are ≥50% confidence
   └─> Show: 3 (first batch)
   
2. User accepts first suggestion
   ├─> visibleCount: 3 → 2
   ├─> Check: 2 < 5? YES
   ├─> Trigger: Load 3 more in background
   └─> UI: Shows "Loading more..." indicator
   
3. While loading, user reviews remaining 2
   ├─> User accepts another
   ├─> visibleCount: 2 → 1
   └─> Loading still in progress...
   
4. Background load completes (~7s)
   ├─> AI returns 3 new suggestions
   ├─> Filter: 2 are ≥50%
   ├─> Append: 2 valid suggestions
   └─> visibleCount: 1 + 2 = 3
   
5. Check triggers again
   ├─> visibleCount: 3 < 5? YES
   ├─> Trigger: Load 3 more
   └─> Continuous flow maintains pool
   
6. Eventually pool fills
   ├─> visibleCount: 5+
   ├─> Check: 5 < 5? NO
   └─> No trigger (user has plenty to review)
   
7. User continues accepting
   ├─> Eventually drops below 5 again
   └─> Cycle repeats until all mapped
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Continuous Loading During Review

**Setup**:
- 15 unmapped leaf elements
- User accepts suggestions quickly

**Expected Flow**:
```
T=0s:   Initial load → 3 suggestions (85%, 72%, 68%)
T=5s:   User accepts first → visibleCount=2 → Trigger load
T=7s:   Background loading started (3 more)
T=10s:  User accepts second → visibleCount=1
T=14s:  Load completes → +2 valid (filtered 1 at 45%)
        visibleCount=3 → Still <5 → Trigger another load
T=17s:  User accepts third → visibleCount=2
T=21s:  Second load completes → +3 valid
        visibleCount=5 → No trigger (pool filled)
```

**Result**: User always has suggestions to review without waiting ✅

---

### Test Case 2: All Suggestions Below 50%

**Setup**:
- Source element with no good matches
- All AI suggestions return <50% confidence

**Expected Behavior**:
```
AI returns 3 suggestions:
  1. Field1 (45%) → Filtered
  2. Field2 (30%) → Filtered
  3. Field3 (15%) → Filtered

Result: No suggestions shown
Console: "🔒 Filtered 3 suggestions (non-leaf or confidence <50%)"
Modal: Empty or closes (no valid suggestions)
```

**User sees**: Either nothing (element skipped) or modal closes
**User understands**: No good matches available for this field ✅

---

### Test Case 3: Mixed Confidence Results

**Setup**:
- AI returns mix of high and low confidence

**AI Response**:
```
1. InvoiceNumber → DocNumber (92%)
2. InvoiceNumber → Number (68%)
3. InvoiceNumber → ID (55%)
4. InvoiceNumber → Code (48%) ← Filtered
5. InvoiceNumber → Reference (25%) ← Filtered
6. InvoiceNumber → Field (10%) ← Filtered
```

**After Filtering**:
```
1. InvoiceNumber → DocNumber (92%) ✅
2. InvoiceNumber → Number (68%) ✅
3. InvoiceNumber → ID (55%) ✅
```

**Result**: User sees top 3 quality matches only ✅

---

### Test Case 4: Continuous Loading Stops When Complete

**Setup**:
- Only 8 unmapped elements total
- User working through them

**Expected Flow**:
```
Initial: Load 3 → visibleCount=3
Accept 1: visibleCount=2 → Load 3 more
         (Only 5 unmapped remain)
Load completes: +3 → visibleCount=5
Accept 2: visibleCount=3 → Load 3 more
         (Only 2 unmapped remain)
Load completes: +2 → visibleCount=5
Accept 3: visibleCount=2 → Try load
         (0 unmapped remain)
Check: remainingUnmappedCount=0 → No load
```

**Result**: Loading stops gracefully when no more elements ✅

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Edge Cases

### 1. No Unmapped Elements Check:
```javascript
if (visibleCount < MIN_VISIBLE_SUGGESTIONS && remainingUnmappedCount > 0)
```
**Prevents**: Trying to load when nothing left to map

### 2. Confidence Threshold:
```javascript
const hasGoodConfidence = suggestion.confidence >= MIN_CONFIDENCE;
```
**Prevents**: Showing poor-quality suggestions

### 3. Loading State Management:
```javascript
setIsLoadingMore(true);
try {
    // Load suggestions
} finally {
    setIsLoadingMore(false);
}
```
**Prevents**: Stuck loading states

### 4. Duplicate Prevention:
```javascript
const mappedSources = new Set(updatedMappings.map(m => m.source));
const unmappedSources = sourceLeafElements.filter(el => !mappedSources.has(el.path));
```
**Prevents**: Suggesting already mapped elements

---

## 📝 Console Logging

### Continuous Loading Logs:
```javascript
// When triggering
"[AI Dynamic Loading] Visible suggestions (2) below minimum (5). Loading more in background..."
"⚡ [FAST LOAD] Processing 3 suggestions in parallel..."

// When completing
"[AI Dynamic Loading] Loaded 2 new suggestions (confidence ≥50%)"
```

### Confidence Filtering Logs:
```javascript
// Individual filters
"⚠️  Filtered out low-confidence suggestion: InvoiceDate → ReferenceNumber (10%)"
"⚠️  Filtered out low-confidence suggestion during dynamic load: 45%"

// Summary
"🔒 Filtered 3 suggestions (non-leaf or confidence <50%)"
```

### Regeneration Logs:
```javascript
// If regenerated suggestion is low confidence
"⚠️  Regenerated suggestion has low confidence (35%), skipping"
```
