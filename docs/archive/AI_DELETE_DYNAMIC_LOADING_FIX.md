# AI Batch Suggestions: Delete Button Dynamic Loading Fix

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Feature:** Enhanced delete button to trigger dynamic loading & fixed modal auto-close logic  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Delete Button Doesn't Trigger Dynamic Loading
**Problem:** When a user deletes a suggestion, the modal doesn't load more suggestions even when running low on visible items.

**Root Cause:** The `handleDeleteSuggestion` in `AIBatchSuggestionModal.jsx` only marked items as hidden locally but didn't notify the parent component to check if dynamic loading should be triggered.

**Solution:** Added `onDeleteSuggestion` callback prop that calls parent's `handleDeleteBatchSuggestion`, which contains the same dynamic loading logic as accept.

---

### Issue 2: Modal Closes Despite Unmapped Leaf Nodes Remaining
**Problem:** When the last visible suggestion is accepted/deleted, the modal auto-closes even if there are still unmapped leaf nodes that could generate more suggestions.

**Root Cause:** Auto-close logic only checked `visibleSuggestions.length === 0` without considering if `remainingCount > 0`.

**Solution:** Enhanced auto-close condition to require:
1. No visible suggestions (`visibleSuggestions.length === 0`)
2. Not loading (`!loading && !isLoadingMore`)
3. **No unmapped elements remaining (`remainingCount === 0`)**

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/components/editor/AIBatchSuggestionModal.jsx`

#### Added `onDeleteSuggestion` Prop
```javascript
export function AIBatchSuggestionModal({ 
    suggestions = [], 
    onAcceptAll, 
    onAcceptSuggestion,
    onDeleteSuggestion,  // ⭐ NEW: Callback to parent for delete actions
    onRegenerateAll,
    // ... other props
}) {
```

#### Enhanced `handleDeleteSuggestion` to Notify Parent
**Before:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteSuggestion = (index) => {
    setRemovingIndices(new Set([index]));
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        setAcceptedIndices(prev => new Set([...prev, index]));
        setRemovingIndices(new Set());
    }, 600);
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteSuggestion = (index) => {
    setRemovingIndices(new Set([index]));
    
    // ⭐ NEW: Call parent handler to trigger dynamic loading check
    if (onDeleteSuggestion) {
        const suggestion = suggestions[index];
        onDeleteSuggestion(suggestion, index);
    }
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        setAcceptedIndices(prev => new Set([...prev, index]));
        setRemovingIndices(new Set());
    }, 600);
};
```

#### Fixed Auto-Close Logic to Check Remaining Count
**Before:**
```javascript
if (visibleSuggestions.length === 0 && !loading && !isLoadingMore) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        onClose();
    }, 800);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ⭐ NEW: Only auto-close if NO remaining unmapped elements
if (visibleSuggestions.length === 0 && !loading && !isLoadingMore && remainingCount === 0) {
    console.log('[Modal Auto-Close] All conditions met: closing modal');
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        onClose();
    }, 800);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
} else if (visibleSuggestions.length === 0 && remainingCount > 0) {
    console.log(`[Modal Auto-Close] Waiting for more suggestions. Remaining: ${remainingCount}, Loading: ${isLoadingMore}`);
}
```

---

### 2. `frontend/src/pages/EditorPage.jsx`

#### Added `handleDeleteBatchSuggestion` Handler
```javascript
const handleDeleteBatchSuggestion = useCallback(async (deletedSuggestion, deletedIndex) => {
    console.log(`[AI Delete] Suggestion deleted at index ${deletedIndex}`);
    
    // Count remaining visible suggestions (not accepted, not deleted)
    const allAcceptedPaths = new Set(mappings.map(m => m.source));
    const visibleCount = batchSuggestions.filter(
        (s, idx) => idx !== deletedIndex && !allAcceptedPaths.has(s.sourceElement?.path)
    ).length;

    const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 3;
    console.log(`[AI Delete -> Dynamic Loading] Visible count after delete: ${visibleCount}, Remaining unmapped: ${remainingUnmappedCount}`);
    
    // ⭐ Trigger dynamic loading if suggestions are getting low
    if (visibleCount < 2 && remainingUnmappedCount > 0) {
        console.log('[AI Delete -> Dynamic Loading] Triggering dynamic load after delete...');
        setIsLoadingMore(true);
        
        try {
            // Same logic as handleAcceptBatchSuggestions
            const sourceLeafElements = collectLeafElements(sourceTree);
            const targetLeafElements = collectLeafElements(targetTree);
            
            // ... (full dynamic loading logic)
            
            if (result.suggestions && result.suggestions.length > 0) {
                console.log(`[AI Delete -> Dynamic Loading] Loaded ${result.suggestions.length} new suggestions after delete`);
                setBatchSuggestions(prev => [...prev, ...result.suggestions]);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error loading more suggestions after delete:', error);
        } finally {
            setIsLoadingMore(false);
        }
    }
}, [mappings, sourceTree, targetTree, batchSuggestions, remainingUnmappedCount, collectLeafElements]);
```

#### Connected Handler to Modal
```javascript
<AIBatchSuggestionModal
    suggestions={batchSuggestions}
    onAcceptSuggestion={handleAcceptBatchSuggestions}
    onDeleteSuggestion={handleDeleteBatchSuggestion}  // ⭐ NEW
    onClose={handleCloseBatchModal}
    // ... other props
/>
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Delete Flow with Dynamic Loading

```
User clicks "Delete" on suggestion
           ↓
handleDeleteSuggestion (Modal)
           ↓
Triggers fade-out animation
           ↓
Calls onDeleteSuggestion(suggestion, index)
           ↓
handleDeleteBatchSuggestion (EditorPage)
           ↓
Counts visible suggestions after delete
           ↓
If visibleCount < 2 AND remainingCount > 0:
           ↓
    setIsLoadingMore(true)
           ↓
    Collect unmapped leaf elements
           ↓
    Generate batch AI suggestions (up to 3)
           ↓
    Append new suggestions to modal
           ↓
    setIsLoadingMore(false)
           ↓
Animation completes → Suggestion hidden
           ↓
Modal stays open with new suggestions!
```

### Auto-Close Decision Tree

```
Modal checks every time dependencies change:
           ↓
Are there visible suggestions?
    ├─ YES → Keep modal open
    └─ NO → Check loading states
                ├─ loading=true OR isLoadingMore=true
                │       → Keep modal open (waiting for suggestions)
                └─ Both false → Check remaining count
                                    ├─ remainingCount > 0
                                    │       → Keep modal open (more elements to map)
                                    └─ remainingCount = 0
                                            → AUTO-CLOSE after 800ms ✅
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete Triggers Dynamic Loading
1. **Given:** Modal shows 2 suggestions, 10 unmapped leaf elements remain
2. **When:** User deletes 1 suggestion
3. **Then:** 
   - Deleted suggestion fades out
   - `isLoadingMore` becomes true
   - "Loading more..." appears in header
   - Up to 3 new suggestions are fetched and appended
   - Modal remains open with new suggestions

### Scenario 2: Modal Stays Open When Unmapped Elements Exist
1. **Given:** Modal shows 1 suggestion, 5 unmapped leaf elements remain
2. **When:** User accepts the last visible suggestion
3. **Then:**
   - Suggestion fades out
   - Dynamic loading triggers
   - New suggestions load
   - Modal stays open (doesn't auto-close)

### Scenario 3: Modal Closes When Work Complete
1. **Given:** Modal shows 1 suggestion, 0 unmapped leaf elements remain
2. **When:** User accepts or deletes the last suggestion
3. **Then:**
   - Suggestion fades out
   - No dynamic loading (nothing left to map)
   - Modal auto-closes after 800ms

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
❌ Delete suggestion → Modal stays with few/no suggestions  
❌ Accept last suggestion → Modal closes despite unmapped elements  
❌ User must manually click "Get AI Suggestions" again  

### After Fix
✅ Delete suggestion → New suggestions load automatically  
✅ Accept last suggestion → More suggestions load if unmapped elements exist  
✅ Modal only closes when truly done (remainingCount = 0)  
✅ Seamless continuous workflow without manual intervention

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dynamic Loading Trigger Condition
```javascript
if (visibleCount < 2 && remainingUnmappedCount > 0)
```
- **`visibleCount < 2`**: Load more when running low on suggestions
- **`remainingUnmappedCount > 0`**: Only if there are unmapped leaf elements

### Auto-Close Trigger Condition
```javascript
if (visibleSuggestions.length === 0 && !loading && !isLoadingMore && remainingCount === 0)
```
- **`visibleSuggestions.length === 0`**: No suggestions currently displayed
- **`!loading`**: Not in initial load
- **`!isLoadingMore`**: Not loading more in background
- **`remainingCount === 0`**: No unmapped elements left

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Delete button triggers dynamic loading when visibleCount < 2
- [x] Modal stays open when deleting with unmapped elements remaining
- [x] Modal auto-closes when last suggestion removed AND remainingCount = 0
- [x] Console logs show correct counts and loading states
- [x] Loading spinner appears during dynamic loading after delete
