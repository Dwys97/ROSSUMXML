## 🚀 Quick Start for New Features

### Adding Security to New Endpoint

```javascript
// backend/routes/example.routes.js
const { 
  requirePermission, 
  requireResourceAccess,
  PERMISSIONS 
} = require('../middleware/rbac');
const { xmlSecurityMiddleware } = require('../middleware/xmlSecurityValidator');

// Example: Create new mapping (requires write permission)
router.post('/mappings', 
  requirePermission(PERMISSIONS.MAPPING_WRITE),
  xmlSecurityMiddleware(), // If handling XML
  async (req, res) => {
    // Your logic here
  }
);

// Example: Delete mapping (requires ownership or admin)
router.delete('/mappings/:id',
  requireResourceAccess('mapping', 'delete', 'id'),
  async (req, res) => {
    // Your logic here
  }
);

// Example: Admin-only endpoint
router.get('/admin/audit-logs',
  requireAdmin(),
  async (req, res) => {
    // Your logic here
  }
);
```

### Testing Security Controls

```bash
# 1. Test XXE Prevention
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/schema/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "xmlString": "<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\">]><root>&xxe;</root>"
  }'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request with XXE detection error

# 2. Test RBAC (Viewer cannot write)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/api-settings/mappings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <viewer_token>" \
  -d '{"mapping_name": "test"}'
# Expected: 403 Forbidden

# 3. Test Resource Ownership
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/api-settings/mappings/999 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden (not owner)

# 4. Test Billion Laughs Protection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/schema/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "xmlString": "<!DOCTYPE lolz [<!ENTITY lol \"lol\"><!ENTITY lol2 \"&lol;&lol;\"><!ENTITY lol3 \"&lol2;&lol2;\">]><root>&lol3;</root>"
  }'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request with billion laughs detection
```

   - Permission denied (threshold: >10/hour per user)
   - Resource access blocked
   - Role escalation attempts

3. **XML Security Events**
   - XXE attempts blocked

   - Oversized payload rejections
   - Malicious pattern matches

4. **Performance Indicators**
   - Average request response time
   - Rate limit violations
   - Failed transformation attempts
   - Database query performance

### Alert Thresholds

| Event | Warning | Critical | Action |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| Failed logins | 3/hour | 5/hour | Lock account |
| XXE attempts | 1 | 1 | Immediate investigation |
| Permission violations | 10/hour | 20/hour | Review user permissions |
| API rate limit hits | 80% quota | 95% quota | Throttle requests |
| Billion laughs | 1 | 1 | Block IP temporarily |
