<root>&xxe;</root>
```

**Result:** Attack blocked with error response, threat logged as `xml_security_threat_detected`

#### ✅ Billion Laughs Attack Detection
- **Test 13:** Billion Laughs attack detected and blocked ✓

**Attack Payload:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE lolz [
  <!ENTITY lol "lol">
  <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
  <!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
]>
<root>&lol3;</root>
```

**Result:** Entity expansion attack blocked before processing

### 3. Phase 1: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Tests (2 tests)

#### ✅ Permission System
- **Test 14:** Admin has required permissions (manage_api_keys) ✓
- **Test 15:** User role assignment verified (admin role) ✓

**Validation:**
- PostgreSQL function `user_has_permission(UUID, VARCHAR)` returns TRUE for admin
- User d.radionovs@gmail.com has admin role in user_roles table
- All 18 permissions available to admin role

---

### 4. Database Integrity Tests (8 tests)

#### ✅ Security Audit Log Table
- **Test 16:** security_audit_log table exists ✓

#### ✅ Audit Log Content Validation
- **Test 19:** 12 audit events created during test run ✓
- **Test 20:** Event type breakdown correct ✓
- **Test 21:** Success/failure flags accurate ✓
- **Test 22:** IP addresses stored correctly ✓
- **Test 23:** Metadata JSON properly formatted ✓

## Audit Log Analysis

### Event Types Captured (9 distinct types)
| Event Type | Count | Successful | Failed |
|------------|-------|------------|--------|
| authorization_success | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| xml_security_threat_detected | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| authentication_success | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| authentication_failed | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| api_key_created | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| api_key_deleted | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| mapping_created | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| mapping_updated | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| mapping_deleted | 1 | 1 | 0 |

**Total Events:** 12 during test execution

## Database Schema Fixes Applied

### Issues Discovered and Resolved

1. **security_audit_log.resource_id type mismatch**
   - **Problem:** Column was INTEGER, but UUIDs needed for api_keys/mappings
   - **Solution:** Changed to TEXT type to support both integers and UUIDs
   - **Impact:** All resource logging now works correctly

2. **resource_ownership.resource_id type mismatch**
   - **Problem:** Column was INTEGER, trigger attempted UUID inserts
   - **Solution:** Changed to TEXT type with updated constraints
   - **Impact:** Resource ownership tracking functional

3. **Duplicate PostgreSQL functions**
   - **Problem:** Two versions of log_security_event() caused ambiguity
   - **Solution:** Dropped old INTEGER version, kept UUID version
   - **Impact:** Audit logging no longer throws errors

4. **Old trigger conflicts**
   - **Problem:** mapping_ownership_trigger used outdated column name
   - **Solution:** Dropped old trigger, kept new auto_create_resource_ownership
   - **Impact:** Mapping creation succeeds without errors

### Next Steps (Phase 3)
1. **Security Monitoring Dashboard API** (In progress)
   - Build admin endpoints to query security_audit_log
   - Add filtering by event type, date range, user
   - Implement pagination for large result sets

2. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Add request throttling to transformation endpoints
   - Track violation attempts in audit log
   - Implement IP-based rate limits (100 req/min)

3. **Security Headers**
   - Add HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP headers
   - Update CORS from wildcard to whitelist
   - Implement X-Content-Type-Options
